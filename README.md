## INTRODUCTION 😎
This is a crop advisory app for farmers and gardeners. It can diagnose pest damage, plant disease and nutrient deficiencies that are affecting crops and can offer corresponding treatment measures.

## WORKING 👨‍💻 

This application takes an image of the leaf or crop as input and shows the results. It diagnoses the plant disease, pest damage, nutrient deficiencies and other factors affecting the growth of the crop and offers corresponding treatment measures to cure it. The result will be mainly presented in three categories, which are symptoms, treatments, and recommended products.

### ANALYZE AND RESULT SCREENS
This is where is all happens. Now I know what you must be thinking what you I mean??🤔
So without wasting much time let me explain you how it works.

1. Maka a touch on the screen and allowed the application to access you phone's media (trust us here, we won't steal anything important 👼)
2. Make sure you upload/select the image you want to analyze. It will also appear on the screen as a preview just to make sure you haven't selected anything by mistake.
3. Hit the `Analyze Button` and just chill out and let the application do it's work. You'll have the result even before you know it. (30 seconds 🙅‍♂️)... Yes I know, we will be upgrading it soon by the help of our amazing Open Source Community. 👫 👭 👬

Bored by just manul instructions, worry not, I have images to understand better. Told you too many spoilers coming your way!!!!!🤓🤭
